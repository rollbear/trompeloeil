v4  2015-05-01

	* Expectations of death do not follow move-constructed and
	  copy-constructed deathwatched<T> objects.

	* Internal rewrites to reduce compilation times

v3   2015-04-02

	* Fixed compiler dependent reference binding SNAFU

v2   2015-04-02

	* Improved compilation time performance. 20% drop in compilation time
	  has been seen in some test programs.

	* Improved the compiler's chance to provide good warning messages
	  when values in expectations don't quite the types used in the
	  function signature (for example signed/unsigned mismatch.)

	* Added support for tracing matching calls. This is an aid when
	  doing exploratory tests of legacy code. A trace can often
	  drastically reduce the time required to understand how the legacy
	  code works.

	  To use it, create an object of a tracer type, for example:

	    TEST(atest)
	    {
	      trompeloeil::stream_tracer trace(std::cout);

	      // normal test code
	    }

v1   2015-01-10

	First official release.
