	* Conditional support for non-awaitable coroutines, like std::generator.
	  Thank you Artem Suleimanov for submitting the improvement.

	* Support C++20 (and higher) on MSVC with the traditional preprocessor.
	  Thank you Kevin Puetz for reporting and submitting the fix.

v49 2024-10-07

	* Added mocking macros that infers function arity from a trailing return
	  type syntax signature.

	    MAKE_MOCK(name, signature {, specifiers})
	    MAKE_CONST_MOCK(name, signature {, specifiers})
	    MAKE_STDMETHOD_MOCK(name, signature {, specifiers})

	  Note that these only work with trailing return type syntax. Examples
	  of specifiers are 'override', 'final' and 'noexcept'

	  The preprocessor is limited and can only handle nullary functions,
	  i.e. functions that do not accept any arguments, in some cases.

	  MSVC handles nullary functions when compiling with /Zc:preprocessor
	  with MSVC 19.40 (VS 17.10) or later.

	  Gcc and Clang always handles nullary functions when compiling with
	  C++20 or later, and when enabling a gcc extension by compiling with
	  -std=gnu++11/14/17 and defining the macro TROMPELOEIL_HAS_GCC_PP before
	  #include:ing the trompeloeil headers.


	* Added .RT_TIMES() to exceptations, which works like .TIMES()
	  but where the limits are only known at runtime. Thank you
	  Dominic Koepke for submitting the implementation.

	* Added several new composable matchers.

	  range matchers range_includes(*elements*), range_is(*elements*),
	  range_is_permutation(*elements*), range_all_of(*comparator*),
	  range_none_of(*comparator*), range_any_of(*comparator*),
	  range_starts_with(*elements*) and range_ends_with(*elements*).

	  Use in expectations as:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, vector_func(range_starts_with(2,3,5,8)));

      MEMBER_IS(ptr_to_mem, matcher). Use as:

        REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(MEMBER_IS(&type::height, gt(5)));

      all_of(matchers), any_of(matchers), none_of(matchers). Use as:

        REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(any_of(-1, gt(0))));

      These can be composed like:

        REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(range_all_of(
                                 any_of(MEMBER_IS(&type::x, -1),
                                        MEMBER_IS(&type::y, gt(0))))));

      Thank you Artem for the suggestion.

	* When an expectation is constrained by several .WITH() clauses, a
	  violation report will only include the first failed condition,
	  short cirquiting the login.

	  Example:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(_))
	    .WITH(_1 != nullptr)
	    .WITH(*_1 == 0); // would be runtime crash on nullptr access

	  Thank you Örjan Gustavsson for the suggestion.

v48 2024-07-17

	* Fixed memory leak when adding an action (.RETURN, .SIDE_EFFECT, etc)
	  throws. Thank you Dominic Koepke for the fix.

	* Dropped older compilers from CI builds (gcc <= 6 and clang <= 7) since
	  GitHub actions now require node-20, and no build environment is
	  currently available that both supports node-20 and older compilers.

	* Support for STDMETHOD functions for COM. Thank you Luis Andres Cesena
	  for the implementation, and Kevin Puetz for the discussions. This
	  adds new macros:

	      MAKE_STDMETHOD_MOCKn(...)
	      IMPLEMENT_STDMETHOD_MOCKn(...)

	* Fixed issue with std::expected causing compilation error. Thank you
	  @subbota-a for reporting

	* Silenced gcc -Weffc++ warnings. Thanks Sven Fischer for the report

v47 2024-01-01

	* Coroutines are conditionally supported by the __cpp_impl_coroutine
	  feature test macro. There is no longer any need to define the
	  TROMPELOEIL_EXPERIMENTAL_COROUTINES macro in order to use coroutines
	  with Trompeloeil.

	* Split the monolithic "trompeloeil.hpp" into several smaller
	  headers. You can continue to #include <trompeloeil.hpp> as usual,
	  but you can also do more fine grained #include:s, which may
	  improve build times. E.g.:

	      #include <trompeloeil/mock.hpp> // basic mock functionality
	      #include <trompeloeil/lifetime.hpp> // REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION etc.
	      #include <trompeloeil/matcher/re.hpp> // regular expressions

	  The reference manual says which header to include to get the
	  functionality for each item. If no header is mentioned, it is in
	  <trompeleil/mock.hpp>

v46 2023-11-06

	* Experimental support for coroutines. Use CO_RETURN (or LR_CO_RETURN)
	  for a member function that has a coroutine return type. Use CO_THROW
	  (or LR_CO_THROW) to throw from a coroutine. Use as many CO_YIELD
	  (or LR_CO_YIELD) from a coroutine function as you like, as long as the
	  promise type supports it.

	  The experimental support must be explicitly enabled with

	    #define TROMPELOEIL_EXPERIMENTAL_COROUTINES
	    #include <trompeloeil.hpp>

	  alternatively

	    #define TROMPELOEIL_EXPERIMENTAL_COROUTINES
	    #include <trompeloeil/mock.hpp>
	    #include <trompeloeil/coro.hpp>

	  trompeloeil::stream_tracer does not produce correct result for
	  coroutines

	* Corrected output of input-range like types. Thank you Dominic Koepke for
	  the fix.

	* The self test program "custom_recursive_mutex" now says that it's
	  succeeded. Thank you @yurivict for reporting the confusion.

	* Self test programs are only build when explicitly setting
	  -DTROMPELOEIL_BUILD_TESTS=yes to the CMake command line.

	* The self test programs require a higher version of CMake (3.19
	  currently)

v45 2023-07-21

	* Support matching regular expressions to std::string view

	* Added adapter for QA Systems Cantata. Thank you Andreas Schätti

v44 2023-04-10

	* Fixed issue 293: Wildcard _ could not match types that can be
	  constructed from any type. This fix unfortunately turns off conversion
	  warnings for REQUIRE_CALL and friends when building with gcc. Thank
	  you @TimonNoethlichs for reporting.

	* Fixed issue 296: Improved sequence violation message when ALLOW_CALL
	  is involved. Thank you Sigurður Sveinn Halldórsson for reporting.

	* Fixed -Wunsafe-buffer-usage warning from clang-16

	* static_assert() when trying to get a runtime value from any matcher

	* Bumped required CMake version to 3.14 or later. Thank you Luke Dennis
	  for reporting.

v43 2022-10-26

	* Added static_assert to duck_typed_matcher's templatized conversion
	  function explaining why it should never be instantiated. Issue 270.

	* Added gcc-12 and clang++-15 to the CI build matrix

	* Fixed issue 272: Support Catch2 piecemeal headers.

	* Fix issue #279 where the doctest adapter showed violation messages
	  as hex addresses for most recent releases of doctest. Thanks
	  @SimonKagstrom for reporting.

	* Fixed an obscure bug where an expectation could match with a sequence
	  object that has run to completion.

	* Specify ARCH_INDEPENDENT when creating package version file in CMake.

v42 2021-12-07

	* Fixed issue 264: Sequence objects did not correctly report
	  is_complete() when there were living, but satisfied, expectations
	  remaining. Thank you Václav Kubernát for reporting.

	* Fixed issue 259 where CMakeFiles.txt wrongly installed trompeloeil
	  for projects that includes it. It is now an option. See FAQ for
	  details. Thank you Ismail Pazarbasi for reporting and fixing.

	* Updated Catch2 to version 2.13.7 to compile unit tests on systems
	  with glibc >= 2.34.

	* Fixed issue 255: Hex dumps showed byte values <= 15(dec) wrong.
	  Thank you Stuart Dootson for reporting.

	* Fixed issue 253: Resolve lingering warnings in early Clang compilers
	  and enable -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant when compiling unit tests
	  with GCC and Clang.

	* Fixed issue 250: Warnings about zero argument variadic macros with
	  clang-msvc. Thank you u3shit for reporting and fixing.

	* Fixed issue 251: trompeloeil::printer<> customization point now
	  supports SFINAE expressions to constrain partial specializations.
	  Thank you  Christian Morales Vega for reporting.

	* Fixed issue 245: Modify cmake to build thread_terror on Windows with
	  MSVC.

	* Use CMake internal Threads::Threads target where needed. Thank you
	  Martin Hořeňovský for reporting.

	* For CI builds, use github actions cacheing of built libc++ to shorten
	  build times.

	* Added CMake install namespace. Thank you offa

	* Fixed bug where an expectation end of life was reported as an error
	  if it was included in a satisfied sequence. Thank you Andy Saul.

v41 2021-06-15

	* catch2 adapter works with CATCH_CONFIG_PREFIX_ALL.
	  thanks Christian Morales Vega

	* Silenced -Wreserved-identifier from Clang "latest" (13.0.0).

	* Silenced (again) the MSVC C4702 warning from the default_return<>()
	  function template.

	* Introduced type trompeloeil::printer<T> as a customization point or
	  formatting data to strings in reports. This has the advantage of
	  allowing partial specializations. The old technique of specializing
	  the function template trompeloeil::print(ostream&, const T&) still
	  works.

v40 2021-03-14

	* Silenced -Wnonnull warning from GCC 9 and newer. Thank you Tony Neubert.

	* Fixed custom reported documentation bug. Thanks Matt Godbolt.

	* Added CMake alias target trompeloeil::trompeloeil.
	  Thank you Leon De Andrade.

	* Documentation markdown fixes. Thank you offa.

	* Moved all CI builds to github actions. travis-ci and appveyor
	  are no longer used.

	* Moved CI coverage collection to codecov.io

	* Conan recipe is now on https://conan.io/center/trompeloeil
	  the old rollbear/stable channel is defunct. Thank you Florian Berchtold.

v39 2020-10-31

	* Fix issue 204: ALLOW_CALL was not respected in sequences.
	  Now ALLOW_CALL in sequence may be skipped, but making a
	  call out of sequence is a violation. NOTE! This fix is likely
	  to break some existing test code!

	* Fix issue 211: #include <QtCore/QChar> before #include <trompeloeil.hpp>
	  caused compilation failure for all expectations.

	* Fix minor spelling errors and markdownlint warnings.

	* Issue 207: Extend cmake script to allow use of libc++ with g++

	* Fix issue 129: Wildcard _ does not match pass-by-value tuple
	  of only one type.

	* Fix issue 197: Add override to virtual destructors
	  to avoid -Wsuggest-destructor-override warnings.

v38 2020-06-08

	* Fixed bug where ALLOW_CALL only worked with sequences
	  if called at least once

	* Fixed bug to support IMPLEMENT_MOCKx and IMPLEMENT_CONST_MOCKx
	  constexpr

	* More fixes to Conan packaging. Thank you Kai Bernhard.

	* Support OK-reporters from the runtime reporter registration
	  API. Thank you Moritz Haase.

	* Rewrites to not trigger deprecation warnings in C++17 builds.
	  Thank you Kasper Laudrup.

v37 2020-02-09

	* Added adapter for the Criterion unit testing framework. Thanks you

	  Etienne Barbier <etienne.barbier@atos.net>

	* Fixes to Conan packaging. Thank you kert

	* Fix issue 180 for GCC and MSVC, where the presence of a type
	  like Qt5/QChar broke compilation of unrelated mock signatures.

	* Fix TROMPELOEIL_CONCAT macro issue to restore compiling with MSVC
	  when traditional preprocessor is enabled.

	* Fix issue 173 for GCC 4.x by performing testing to confirm
	  correctness of existing code.

v36 2019-12-29

	* Status reporting of passed expectation calls as successful assertions in
	  DOCTEST and Catch2. Thanks to:

	    Tore Martin Hagen <tore@instanes.name> for Catch2
	    Cristian Morales Vega <cristian@samknows.com> for DOCTEST

	  You get the support via the provided headers

	    #include <catch2/trompeloeil.hpp>
	    #include <doctest/trompeloeil.hpp>

	  See the CookBook for information about adding such hooks for other unit
	  testing frame works.

	* Fixed issue 172 where THROW() would not compile if the function returns
	  a type that is not default constructible.

	* Partially fixed issue 173, where an object constructible from nullptr
	  but not comparable with nullptr, would be constructed when printed
	  (for example when an expectation failed.)

	  Unfortunately this fix does not work for gcc versions 4.x or MSVC 14.

v35 2019-04-01

	* Improvements to documentation. Thanks to:

	    Robert Dailey <rcdailey@gmail.com>
	    Yuri Timenkov <yuri@timenkov.ru>
	    Viatorus <lutztonineubert@gmail.com>

	* Improved DocTest integration. Thanks to:

	    Cristian Morales Vega <cristian@samknows.com>

	* CMakeLists.txt honours CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR. Thanks to:

	    Cristian Morales Vega <cristian@samknows.com>

	* Partially fixed issue 155, where an unfulfilled expectation, when
	  built with the default throwing reporter, terminated without a
	  message when compiled with gcc and optimization. With the partial
	  fix the program still terminates, but with the correct violation
	  message displayed.

	* Fixed issue 157 where it was impossible to place an expectation on a
	  reference to a non-copyable type. This fix also resolved a number of
	  problems with older compilers. See docs/Backward.md for details.

	* Fixed clang-tidy warning, misc-non-private-member-variables-in-classes
	  that leaks into application code from the Trompeloeil header.

v34 2019-04-01

	* Rearranged include directory structure to make it easier to use, and
	  to write, adapters for unit test frame works. Now, if you want to
	  use Trompeloeil with, for example, the 'doctest' unit testing frame
	  work, you include

	  #include <doctest.h>
	  #include <doctest/trompeloeil.hpp>

	  The old adaptation mechanisms still work. See issue #118

	* Support compilation without RTTI support. This makes error reporting
	  from deathwatched<> violations less informative (it cannot mention
	  the name of the type of the object) but has no other impact on
	  functionality.

	* Silenced g++-4.9 -Wmissing-field-initializers warning with libc++.

	* Fixed issue #121 where mutexes were created in each translation unit

	* Fixed issue #124 where sequence objects were not properly protected
	  against access from several threads.

	* Silenced several warnings in the Trompeloeil self test programs.

v33 2019-01-21

	* Silenced noisy g++-7 -Wuseless-cast warning

	* Fixed a bug where a mocked function would not compile if a parameter
	  had an operator==(nullptr) returning a type that is not convertible
	  to bool.

	* Fixed a bug where a mocked function would not compile if a parameter
	  was a range with iterators to rvalue proxy objects, like vector<bool>.

	* Mock objects can be move constructed if they have a static constexpr
	  bool member named trompeloeil_movable_mock with value = true.

	* ANY() matcher gives a short descriptive compilation error message
	  when the type is an array type (it would silently decay into a
	  pointer type, which can be very confusing.)

	* When compiled with preprocessor macro
	  TROMPELOEIL_USER_DEFINED_COMPILE_TIME_REPORTER, a `extern`
	  `trompeloeil::reporter` is declared from `trompeloeil.hpp`.
	  Thanks @rcdailey

	* Minor documentation updates.

	* Update pattern in expectation_with_wrong_type.cpp to match
	  new error message from GCC '9' at svn revision 264700.

v32 2018-07-23

	* Fix issue #95: check_errors.sh typo and detect failure in Travis

	* Update unit test framework to Catch 2.2.3.

	* Fix documentation of sanitize flags

	* Enable destructor override warning in self_test build for Clang 5.0
	  or later

	* Update unit test framework to Catch 2.2.1.

	* Worked around clang++-6 bugs 38010 and 38033

	* Improve support for compiler modes:
	  GCC and Clang: -std=c++17; MSVC: /std:c++17
	  GCC and Clang: -std=c++2a; MSVC: /std:c++latest

	* Fix issue #87: C4355 warning from VS Release builds.  Thanks @Neargye

	* Fix issue #69: work around C4702 warning from VS Release builds.

	* Fix issue #88: work around C2066 error from VS 2017 15.7.1.

v31 2018-05-11

	* Issue #83: Add AppVeyor support for VS 2015 and VS 2017

	* Fix issue #82: restore compilation with VS 2015.


v30 2018-04-02

	* mock_interface<T> provides a convenient short cut when implementing
	  mocks from interfaces. It is used together with the macros
	  IMPLEMENT_MOCKn(func_name) and IMPLEMENT_CONST_MOCKn(func_name).
	  The signature of the function is deduced. It is not possible to use
	  mock_interface<T> with multiple inheritance, and it is not possible
	  to mock overloads with IMPLEMENT_MOCKn(func_name) or
	  IMPLEMENT_CONST_MOCKn(func_name)

	* Used markdownlint to make documentation more consistent. Thanks @AndrewPaxie

	* Silenced 2 clang++-5 warnings about missing "override"

	Back ported Trompeloeil to C++11. Thanks @AndrewPaxie!
	Changes by file and directory:
	* Cleaned up `.travis.yml`
	* Cleaned up `CMakeLists.txt` and bumped kcov for travis builds
	* `README.md`
	  * Updated supported compiler list.
	  * Added link to `docs/Backward.md`.
	  * Added link to `docs/PlatformAndLibraries.md`.
	* `check_errors.sh` require `CXXFLAGS` with either `-std=c++11` or `-std=c++14`.
	* `docs/FAQ.md`
	  * Updated supported compilers list.
	  * Updated answer regarding C++11 support.
	* `docs/`
	  * New: "Backward compatibility with earlier versions of C++".
	  * New: "Platform and library support for Trompeloeil".
	* `compilation_errors/`
	  * Support for C++11 expectation syntax in test cases.
	* `test/`
	  * Split `compiling_tests.cpp` into separately compilable files,
	    for Catch main, C++11 test cases and C++14 test cases.

	* Fixed whitespace and a minor spelling error in trompeloeil.hpp.
	* Tidy up test cases in compilation_errors.

v29 2017-07-23

	* Fix Issue #54: Exception thrown exit - fixed static dtor fiasco
	* Fix Issue #48: Move "re" in lambda capture list in "regex_check".
	* Fix Issue #55: Restore warnings for Clang builds.
	* Correct spelling of SANITIZE for clang Xcode builds.
	* Fix Issue #57: Avoid unneeded-member-function warning from Clang.
	* Allow only standard C++ dialects in Trompeloeil test programs.
	* Lightly edited documentation.

v28 2017-07-24

	* You can place expectations on types multiply inheriting several
	  mock types.

	* Changed directory structure. "trompeloeil.hpp" now resides in
	  directory "include". Self test programs "compiling_tests.cpp"
	  and "thread_terror.cpp" resides in directory "test".

	* Major work on CMake support
	  - "make install" - works as before and also includes a package
	  - For CMake based project you can use
	    . "find_package(trompeloeil 28 REQUIRED)" and add
	      "target_link_libraries(<test_program> trompeloeil)" for your test
	      target
	    . use "add_subdirectory(trompeloeil)" if you prefer to track
	      the trompeloeil git repository and also here add
	      "target_link_libraries(<test_program> trompeloeil)" for your test
	      target
	  - "cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug <trompeloeil-dir>" enables the test
	    targets "self_test" and "thread_terror"
	    . "-DSANITIZE" enables ASAN and UBSAN for "self_test", and TSAN and
	      UBSAN for "thread_terror"

v27 2017-06-27

	* Fixed a regression where NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj) accidentally
	  resulted in a std::unique_ptr<trompeloeil::expectation> instead
	  of std::unique_ptr<trompeloeil::lifetime_monitor> as documented.

	* Added a rudimentary CMakeLists.txt file. Thanks Harald Achitz.

v26 2017-06-12

	* Support for threaded semi-integration tests by allowing
	  queries if a sequence object "is_completed()", if an
	  expectation objet "is_satisfied()" or "is_saturated()".

	  See FAQ and reference manual for details.

	* Internal restructuring for reduced code size.

v25 2017-04-17

	* Changed the expectation macros such that you can now have a
	  macro that expands into several REQUIRE_CALL() (and the likes)

	* Fixed macro expansion bugs causing name clashes.

	* Documented clang++ 4 compatibility

	* Sequence objects are now movable and can, for example, be
	  returned from functions.

v24 2017-03-10

	* Worked around VS2017 bug. Thanks mlimber and xiangfan-ms

v23 2017-01-29

	* Matchers can be negated using the logical not operator !.

	  Example:

	  struct Mock {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(const std::string&));
	  };

	  TEST(...)
	  {
	    using trompeloeil::re; // match regular expressions
	    Mock m;
	    REQUIRE_CALL(m, func(!re("^foo")));
	      // calls to func with strings not matching the regex /^foo/
	    ...
	  }

	* Made sequence and its dependencies moveable. (mlimber)

	  This means it's now possible to use tha Almost Always Auto
	  style for sequence objects:

	  auto seq = trompeloeil::sequence{};

	* Internal refactoring for substantially reduced compilation time.

v22 2016-12-13

	* Messages from violations of expectations now print collections
	  member wise. This goes for std::pair<>, std::tuple<> and any data
	  type for which a range based for loop is possible. This is done
	  recursively for the contents of the collections.

	* Worked around gcc bug 78446
	  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=78446

	* Cleaned up -Wshadow warnings from gcc

v21 2016-11-13

	* Tracing now includes return values and exceptions thrown.
	  For exception types inherited from std::exception, the
	  what() string is printed.

	* Fixed a bug when a member function in a mocked class calls
	  a mocked function. This is now explicitly allowed, even
	  when an expectation recursively calls the same function
	  as a side effect.

	* Worked around VisualStudio 2015 update 3 issue where trailing
	  return type for lambdas is not respected in template deduction
	  context. This caused compilation errors when using matchers
	  in expectations to overloaded functions.

	* Worked around VisualStudio 2015 update 3 issue with evaluating
	  regex_search() in trailing return type spec for auto deduced
	  string type.

v20 2016-10-05

	* Fixed harmless but very very annoying warning from clang++

v19 2016-10-03

	* Fixed obscure bug when placing an expectation using a value implicitly
	  convertible to the target type, but not equal comparable with it.

	  Example:

	  struct S
	  {
	    S(const char* s_) : s(s_) {}
	    bool operator(const char*) = delete;
	    bool operator==(const S& rh) const
	    {
              return s == rh.s;
	    }
	    std::string s;
	  };

	  struct mock {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(S));
	  };

	  TEST(...)
	  {
	    mock m;
	    REQUIRE_CALL(m, func("string"));
	    // now compiles and compares the function call parameter value
	    // with S("string")
	  }

	* Improved compilation error messages for type-mismatch
	  situations in .RETURN()

v18 2016-08-18

	* Writing custom matchers is much simplified through the use
	  of function template make_matcher<>, which accepts lambdas
	  for predicate and printing error message.

	  The old technique of inheriting form trompeloeil::matcher
	  or trompeloeil::typed_matcher<T> still works.

	* Further internal restructuring for yet reduced test program
	  build time.

v17 2016-06-11

	* Use template specialization when writing adapter code for unit
	  testing frame works.

	* Internal restructuring for shorter compilation times.

v16 2016-05-16

	* class trompeloeil::lifetime_monitor now inherits from
	  class trompeloeil::expectation, so using

	  std::unique_ptr<expectation> p = NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj);

	  instead of

	  std::unique_ptr<lifetime_monitor> p = NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj);

	  works equally well, reduces the cognitive load a bit, and seems to
	  build slightly faster.

	* .IN_SEQUENCE(...) can now be used with REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(...)
	  and NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(...) to ensure objects are
	  destroyed in the intended order. Example:

	  auto p1 = new trompeloeil::deathwatched<mock1>;
	  auto p2 = new trompeloeil::deathwatched<mock2>;

	  trompeloeil::sequence s;
	  REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(*p1)
	    .IN_SEQUENCE(s);
	  REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(*p2)
	    .IN_SEQUENCE(s);
	  call_destroyer(p1, p2); // both must be destroyed, p1 before p2.

v15 2016-04-29

	* Fixed macro bug that caused warnings with g++ and clang++ when
	  compiling with strict C++ standards compliance.

v14 2016-04-27

	* Fixed bug when the destruction of a sequence object with still
	  living expectations caused call to abort().

	* You can now add extra trailing specifiers to a mock function,
	  such as the "override" context sensitive specifier, and/or the
	  keyword "noexcept" (careful with the latter if your registered
	  reporter can/does throw.)

	  Example:

	  struct D : public B {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, int(int), override);
	  };


v13 2016-03-07

	* Mock functions and their expectations are thread safe, using
	  a global recursive mutex.

	* Silenced warnings from g++ -Wshadow.

v12 2016-02-01

	* Built in matchers are duck typed by default, i.e. eq, ne, gt, ge,
	  lt, le do by default match any parameter that supports operators
	  ==, !=, >, >=, <, <= with the value provided. If needed for
	  disambiguation of overloads an explicit type can be provided. Example:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, numfunc(gt(3)));
	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, strfunc(eq<std::string&>("foo")));

	  The expectation on numfunc will match a function numfunc with
	  any parameter type that can be compared as > 3. The expectation on
	  strfunc will only match an overload with std::string& (if there are
	  competing overloads, e.g. strfunc(const char*) and
	  strfunc(const std::string).)

	* Fixed a bug with return type deduction where an array type expression
	  was used. E.g. returning a string literal when the return type was
	  const char* or std::string caused a compilation error.

	* Fixed a bug when the eq(nullptr) matcher actually checked if !=
	  comparison with nullptr was allowed.

	* Reluctantly reverted use of std::tuple_element_t<> for
	  typename tuple_element<>::type, to support g++ 4.9.0 (4.9.1 does have
	  std::tuple_element_t<>.)

v11 2016-01-04

	* Added regular expression matcher for std::string and c-strings

	* Added specialization eq<nullptr> for pointer-like parameters and
	  pointer-to-member parameters. This is mostly useful for
	  pointer to pointer parameters, e.g.:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(*trompeloeil::eq(nullptr)));

	* Improved accuracy of compilation error message when attempting
	  to place expectation that does not uniquely match any function
	  signature.

	* Added specialization eq<nullptr> for pointer-like parameters and
v10 2015-12-11

	* Fixed bug when wildcard _ could not match std::ostream&

	* Fixed ADL bugs

	* Added functionality to use the dereference operator (prefix
	  operator*) on any matcher to instead match a pointer to the
	  value to check.

	* Documented adapter for VisualStudio MSTest

	* Corrected documentation bug for how to write report formatting
	  function trompeloeil::print<>(std::ostream&, T const&).

v9  2015-11-29

	* Fixed bug with accepting std::unique_ptr<> by value.

	* Signed/unsigned compilation warnings in expectations are attributed
	  to correct file/line with clang++ and VisualStudio 2015

	* Complete documentation overhaul. Now with:
	  - Cook book
	  - FAQ
	  - reference manual

	* Better compilation error message when illegal argument is
	  used in expectation.

	* Addressed clang++ and VisualStudio warnings

v8  2015-10-30

	* Fixed bug when mock object was destroyed with a saturated
	  expectation in scope.

	* Further improved compilation error messages.

v7  2015-10-24

	* Report error if live expectations remain when a mock object is
	  destroyed

	* Reduced clutter in compilation errors

	* Allow mock objects to be templates. E.g.

		template <typename T>
		struct mock
		{
			MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(T));
		};

	  Note that member function templates are still not supported.


v6  2015-09-22

	* Verified support for released Visual Studio 2015

	* trompeloeil::ne(nullptr) works for all pointer types

	* Fixed a few issues reported by clang 3.7 sanitizers

	* line number in reporter_func is unsigned long to match
	  type of __LINE__


v5  2015-06-19

	* Support for Visual Studio 2015 RC

	* 5 parameter value matchers are included. These are
	  (in namespace trompeloeil):
	  - ne(x) - not equal to x
	  - lt(x) - less than x
	  - le(x) - less than or equal to x
	  - gt(x) - greater than x
	  - ge(x) - greater than or equal to x

	  These are used in expectations as e.g.:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, foo(ne(5)));

	  which matches calls to foo with a value not equal to 5.

	* Support and documentation for how to write custom matchers.

	* The function registered to set_reporter() now must accept
	  the source location as file, line instead of location as
	  a combined string. Apologies for breaking existing code,
	  but since this is more in line with how other frame works
	  refers to source code locations, it improves compatibility.

v4  2015-05-01

	* Expectations of death do not follow move-constructed and
	  copy-constructed deathwatched<T> objects.

	* Internal rewrites to reduce compilation times

v3   2015-04-02

	* Fixed compiler dependent reference binding SNAFU

v2   2015-04-02

	* Improved compilation time performance. 20% drop in compilation time
	  has been seen in some test programs.

	* Improved the compiler's chance to provide good warning messages
	  when values in expectations don't quite the types used in the
	  function signature (for example signed/unsigned mismatch.)

	* Added support for tracing matching calls. This is an aid when
	  doing exploratory tests of legacy code. A trace can often
	  drastically reduce the time required to understand how the legacy
	  code works.

	  To use it, create an object of a tracer type, for example:

	    TEST(atest)
	    {
	      trompeloeil::stream_tracer trace(std::cout);

	      // normal test code
	    }

v1   2015-01-10

	First official release.
