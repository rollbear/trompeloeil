	* Basic support for Visual Studio 2015 RC

	* 5 parameter value matchers are included. These are
	  (in namespace trompeloeil):
	  - ne(x) - not equal to x
	  - lt(x) - less than x
	  - le(x) - less than or equal to x
	  - gt(x) - greater than x
	  - ge(x) - greater than or equal to x

	  These are used in expectations as e.g.:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, foo(ne(5)));

	  which matches calls to foo with a value not equal to 5.

	* Support and documenation for how to write custom matchers.

	* The function registered to set_reporter() now must accept
	  the source location as file, line instead of location as
	  a combined string. Apologies for breaking existing code,
	  but since this is more in line with how other frame works
	  refers to source code locations, it improves compatibility.

v4  2015-05-01

	* Expectations of death do not follow move-constructed and
	  copy-constructed deathwatched<T> objects.

	* Internal rewrites to reduce compilation times

v3   2015-04-02

	* Fixed compiler dependent reference binding SNAFU

v2   2015-04-02

	* Improved compilation time performance. 20% drop in compilation time
	  has been seen in some test programs.

	* Improved the compiler's chance to provide good warning messages
	  when values in expectations don't quite the types used in the
	  function signature (for example signed/unsigned mismatch.)

	* Added support for tracing matching calls. This is an aid when
	  doing exploratory tests of legacy code. A trace can often
	  drastically reduce the time required to understand how the legacy
	  code works.

	  To use it, create an object of a tracer type, for example:

	    TEST(atest)
	    {
	      trompeloeil::stream_tracer trace(std::cout);

	      // normal test code
	    }

v1   2015-01-10

	First official release.
