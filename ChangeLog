	* Support compilation without RTTI support. This makes error reporting
	  from deathwatched<> violations less informative (it cannot mention
	  the name of the type of the object) but has no other impact on
	  functionality.

	* Silenced GCC -Wctor-dtor-privacy warning in unit tests.

	* Ran GCC with -Wnoexcept enabled and used warning output
	  to add noexcept specifier to some functions in unit tests.

	* Removed unneeded side-effect test from test case
	  compiler_errors/return_wrong_pointer_constness.cpp.

	* Silenced g++-4.9 -Wmissing-field-initializers warning with libc++.

	* Fixed issue #121 where mutexes were created in each translation unit

	* Fixed issue #124 where sequence objects were not properly protected
	  against access from several threads.

v33 2019-01-21

	* Silenced noisy g++-7 -Wuseless-cast warning

	* Fixed a bug where a mocked function would not compile if a parameter
	  had an operator==(nullptr) returning a type that is not convertible
	  to bool.

	* Fixed a bug where a mocked function would not compile if a parameter
	  was a range with iterators to rvalue proxy objects, like vector<bool>.

	* Mock objects can be move constructed if they have a static constexpr
	  bool member named trompeloeil_movable_mock with value = true.

	* ANY() matcher gives a short descriptive compilation error message
	  when the type is an array type (it would silently decay into a
	  pointer type, which can be very confusing.)

	* When compiled with preprocessor macro
	  TROMPELOEIL_USER_DEFINED_COMPILE_TIME_REPORTER, a `extern`
	  `trompeloeil::reporter` is declared from `trompeloeil.hpp`.
	  Thanks @rcdailey

	* Minor documentation updates.

	* Update pattern in expectation_with_wrong_type.cpp to match
	  new error message from GCC '9' at svn revision 264700.

v32 2018-07-23

	* Fix issue #95: check_errors.sh typo and detect failure in Travis

	* Update unit test framework to Catch 2.2.3.

	* Fix documentation of sanitize flags

	* Enable destructor override warning in self_test build for Clang 5.0
	  or later

	* Update unit test framework to Catch 2.2.1.

	* Worked around clang++-6 bugs 38010 and 38033

	* Improve support for compiler modes:
	  GCC and Clang: -std=c++17; MSVC: /std:c++17
	  GCC and Clang: -std=c++2a; MSVC: /std:c++latest

	* Fix issue #87: C4355 warning from VS Release builds.  Thanks @Neargye

	* Fix issue #69: work around C4702 warning from VS Release builds.

	* Fix issue #88: work around C2066 error from VS 2017 15.7.1.

v31 2018-05-11

	* Issue #83: Add AppVeyor support for VS 2015 and VS 2017

	* Fix issue #82: restore compilation with VS 2015.


v30 2018-04-02

	* mock_interface<T> provides a convenient short cut when implementing
	  mocks from interfaces. It is used together with the macros
	  IMPLEMENT_MOCKn(func_name) and IMPLEMENT_CONST_MOCKn(func_name).
	  The signature of the function is deduced. It is not possible to use
	  mock_interface<T> with multiple inheritance, and it is not possible
	  to mock overloads with IMPLEMENT_MOCKn(func_name) or
	  IMPLEMENT_CONST_MOCKn(func_name)

	* Used markdownlint to make documentation more consistent. Thanks @AndrewPaxie

	* Silenced 2 clang++-5 warnings about missing "override"

	Back ported Trompeloeil to C++11. Thanks @AndrewPaxie!
	Changes by file and directory:
	* Cleaned up `.travis.yml`
	* Cleaned up `CMakeLists.txt` and bumped kcov for travis builds
	* `README.md`
	  * Updated supported compiler list.
	  * Added link to `docs/Backward.md`.
	  * Added link to `docs/PlatformAndLibraries.md`.
	* `check_errors.sh` require `CXXFLAGS` with either `-std=c++11` or `-std=c++14`.
	* `docs/FAQ.md`
	  * Updated supported compilers list.
	  * Updated answer regarding C++11 support.
	* `docs/`
	  * New: "Backward compatibility with earlier versions of C++".
	  * New: "Platform and library support for Trompeloeil".
	* `compilation_errors/`
	  * Support for C++11 expectation syntax in test cases.
	* `test/`
	  * Split `compiling_tests.cpp` into separately compilable files,
	    for Catch main, C++11 test cases and C++14 test cases.

	* Fixed whitespace and a minor spelling error in trompeloeil.hpp.
	* Tidy up test cases in compilation_errors.

v29 2017-07-23

	* Fix Issue #54: Exception thrown exit - fixed static dtor fiasco
	* Fix Issue #48: Move "re" in lambda capture list in "regex_check".
	* Fix Issue #55: Restore warnings for Clang builds.
	* Correct spelling of SANITIZE for clang Xcode builds.
	* Fix Issue #57: Avoid uneeded-member-function warning from Clang.
	* Allow only standard C++ dialects in Trompeloeil test programs.
	* Lightly edited documentation.

v28 2017-07-24

	* You can place expectations on types multiply inheriting several
	  mock types.

	* Changed directory structure. "trompeloeil.hpp" now resides in
	  directory "include". Self test programs "compiling_tests.cpp"
	  and "thread_terror.cpp" resides in directory "test".

	* Major work on CMake support
	  - "make install" - works as before and also includes a package
	  - For CMake based project you can use
	    . "find_package(trompeloeil 28 REQUIRED)" and add
	      "target_link_libraries(<test_program> trompeloeil)" for your test
	      target
	    . use "add_subdirectory(trompeloeil)" if you prefer to track
	      the trompeloeil git repository and also here add
	      "target_link_libraries(<test_program> trompeloeil)" for your test
	      target
	  - "cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug <trompeloeil-dir>" enables the test
	    targets "self_test" and "thread_terror"
	    . "-DSANITIZE" enables ASAN and UBSAN for "self_test", and TSAN and
	      UBSAN for "thread_terror"

v27 2017-06-27

	* Fixed a regression where NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj) accidentally
	  resulted in a std::unique_ptr<trompeloeil::expectation> instead
	  of std::unique_ptr<trompeloeil::lifetime_monitor> as documented.

	* Added a rudimentary CMakeLists.txt file. Thanks Harald Achitz.

v26 2017-06-12

	* Support for threaded semi-integration tests by allowing
	  queries if a sequence object "is_completed()", if an
	  expectation objet "is_satisfied()" or "is_saturated()".

	  See FAQ and reference manual for details.

	* Internal restructuring for reduced code size.

v25 2017-04-17

	* Changed the expectation macros such that you can now have a
	  macro that expands into several REQUIRE_CALL() (and the likes)

	* Fixed macro expansion bugs causing name clashes.

	* Documented clang++ 4 compatibility

	* Sequence objects are now movable and can, for example, be
	  returned from functions.

v24 2017-03-10

	* Worked around VS2017 bug. Thanks mlimber and xiangfan-ms

v23 2017-01-29

	* Matchers can be negated using the logical not operator !.

	  Example:

	  struct Mock {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(const std::string&));
	  };

	  TEST(...)
	  {
	    using trompeloeil::re; // match regular expressions
	    Mock m;
	    REQUIRE_CALL(m, func(!re("^foo")));
	      // calls to func with strings not matching the regex /^foo/
	    ...
	  }

	* Made sequence and its dependencies moveable. (mlimber)

	  This means it's now possible to use tha Almost Always Auto
	  style for sequence objects:

	  auto seq = trompeloeil::sequence{};

	* Internal refactoring for substantially reduced compilation time.

v22 2016-12-13

	* Messages from violations of expectations now print collections
	  member wise. This goes for std::pair<>, std::tuple<> and any data
	  type for which a range based for loop is possible. This is done
	  recursively for the contents of the collections.

	* Worked around gcc bug 78446
	  https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=78446

	* Cleaned up -Wshadow warnings from gcc

v21 2016-11-13

	* Tracing now includes return values and exceptions thrown.
	  For exception types inherited from std::exception, the
	  what() string is printed.

	* Fixed a bug when a member function in a mocked class calls
	  a mocked function. This is now explicitly allowed, even
	  when an expectation recursively calls the same function
	  as a side effect.

	* Worked around VisualStudio 2015 update 3 issue where trailing
	  return type for lambdas is not respected in template deduction
	  context. This caused compilation errors when using matchers
	  in expectations to overloaded functions.

	* Worked around VisualStudio 2015 update 3 issue with evaluating
	  regex_search() in trailing return type spec for auto deduced
	  string type.

v20 2016-10-05

	* Fixed harmless but very very annoying warning from clang++

v19 2016-10-03

	* Fixed obscure bug when placing an expectation using a value implicitly
	  convertible to the target type, but not equal comparable with it.

	  Example:

	  struct S
	  {
	    S(const char* s_) : s(s_) {}
	    bool operator(const char*) = delete;
	    bool operator==(const S& rh) const
	    {
              return s == rh.s;
	    }
	    std::string s;
	  };

	  struct mock {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(S));
	  };

	  TEST(...)
	  {
	    mock m;
	    REQUIRE_CALL(m, func("string"));
	    // now compiles and compares the function call parameter value
	    // with S("string")
	  }

	* Improved compilation error messages for type-mismatch
	  situations in .RETURN()

v18 2016-08-18

	* Writing custom matchers is much simplified through the use
	  of function template make_matcher<>, which accepts lambdas
	  for predicate and printing error message.

	  The old technique of inheriting form trompeloeil::matcher
	  or trompeloeil::typed_matcher<T> still works.

	* Further internal restructuring for yet reduced test program
	  build time.

v17 2016-06-11

	* Use template specialization when writing adapter code for unit
	  testing frame works.

	* Internal restructuring for shorter compilation times.

v16 2016-05-16

	* class trompeloeil::lifetime_monitor now inherits from
	  class trompeloeil::expectation, so using

	  std::unique_ptr<expectation> p = NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj);

	  instead of

	  std::unique_ptr<lifetime_monitor> p = NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(obj);

	  works equally well, reduces the cognitive load a bit, and seems to
	  build slightly faster.

	* .IN_SEQUENCE(...) can now be used with REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(...)
	  and NAMED_REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(...) to ensure objects are
	  destroyed in the intended order. Example:

	  auto p1 = new trompeloeil::deathwatched<mock1>;
	  auto p2 = new trompeloeil::deathwatched<mock2>;

	  trompeloeil::sequence s;
	  REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(*p1)
	    .IN_SEQUENCE(s);
	  REQUIRE_DESTRUCTION(*p2)
	    .IN_SEQUENCE(s);
	  call_destroyer(p1, p2); // both must be destroyed, p1 before p2.

v15 2016-04-29

	* Fixed macro bug that caused warnings with g++ and clang++ when
	  compiling with strict C++ standards compliance.

v14 2016-04-27

	* Fixed bug when the destruction of a sequence object with still
	  living expectations caused call to abort().

	* You can now add extra trailing specifiers to a mock function,
	  such as the "override" context sensitive specifier, and/or the
	  keyword "noexcept" (careful with the latter if your registered
	  reporter can/does throw.)

	  Example:

	  struct D : public B {
	    MAKE_MOCK1(func, int(int), override);
	  };


v13 2016-03-07

	* Mock functions and their expectations are thread safe, using
	  a global recursive mutex.

	* Silenced warnings from g++ -Wshadow.

v12 2016-02-01

	* Built in matchers are duck tuped by default, i.e. eq, ne, gt, ge,
	  lt, le do by default match any parameter that supports operators
	  ==, !=, >, >=, <, <= with the value provided. If needed for
	  disambiguation of overloads an explicit type can be provided. Example:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, numfunc(gt(3)));
	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, strfunc(eq<std::string&>("foo")));

	  The expectation on numfunc will match a function numfunc with
	  any parameter type that can be compared as > 3. The expectation on
	  strfunc will only match an overload with std::string& (if there are
	  competing overloads, e.g. strfunc(const char*) and
	  strfunc(const std::string).)

	* Fixed a bug with return type deduction where an array type expression
	  was used. E.g. returning a string literal when the return type was
	  const char* or std::string caused a compilation error.

	* Fixed a bug when the eq(nullptr) matcher actually checked if !=
	  comparison with nullptr was allowed.

	* Reluctantly reverted use of std::tuple_element_t<> for
	  typename tuppe_element<>::type, to support g++ 4.9.0 (4.9.1 does have
	  std::tuple_element_t<>.)

v11 2016-01-04

	* Added regular expression matcher for std::string and c-strings

	* Added specialization eq<nullptr> for pointer-like parameters and
	  pointer-to-member parameters. This is mostly useful for
	  pointer to pointer parameters, e.g.:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, func(*trompeloeil::eq(nullptr)));

	* Improved accuracy of compilation error message when attempting
	  to place expectation that does not uniquely match any function
	  signature.

	* Added specialization eq<nullptr> for pointer-like parameters and
v10 2015-12-11

	* Fixed bug when wildcard _ could not match std::ostream&

	* Fixed ADL bugs

	* Added functionality to use the dereference operator (prefix
	  operator*) on any matcher to instead match a pointer to the
	  value to check.

	* Documented adapter for VisualStudio MSTest

	* Corrected documentation bug for how to write report formatting
	  function trompeloeil::print<>(std::ostream&, T const&).

v9  2015-11-29

	* Fixed bug with accepting std::unique_ptr<> by value.

	* Signed/unsigned compilation warnings in expectations are attributed
	  to correct file/line with clang++ and VisualStudio 2015

	* Complete documentation overhaul. Now with:
	  - Cook book
	  - FAQ
	  - reference manual

	* Better compilation error message when illegal argument is
	  used in expectation.

	* Addressed clang++ and VisualStudio warnings

v8  2015-10-30

	* Fixed bug when mock object was destroyed with a saturated
	  expecation in scope.

	* Further improved compilation error messages.

v7  2015-10-24

	* Report error if live expectations remain when a mock object is
	  destroyed

	* Reduced clutter in compilation errors

	* Allow mock objects to be templates. E.g.

		template <typename T>
		struct mock
		{
			MAKE_MOCK1(func, void(T));
		};

	  Note that member function templates are still not supported.


v6  2015-09-22

	* Verified support for released Visual Studio 2015

	* trompeloeil::ne(nullptr) works for all pointer types

	* Fixed a few issues reported by clang 3.7 sanitizers

	* line number in reporter_func is unsigned long to match
	  type of __LINE__


v5  2015-06-19

	* Support for Visual Studio 2015 RC

	* 5 parameter value matchers are included. These are
	  (in namespace trompeloeil):
	  - ne(x) - not equal to x
	  - lt(x) - less than x
	  - le(x) - less than or equal to x
	  - gt(x) - greater than x
	  - ge(x) - greater than or equal to x

	  These are used in expectations as e.g.:

	    REQUIRE_CALL(obj, foo(ne(5)));

	  which matches calls to foo with a value not equal to 5.

	* Support and documentation for how to write custom matchers.

	* The function registered to set_reporter() now must accept
	  the source location as file, line instead of location as
	  a combined string. Apologies for breaking existing code,
	  but since this is more in line with how other frame works
	  refers to source code locations, it improves compatibility.

v4  2015-05-01

	* Expectations of death do not follow move-constructed and
	  copy-constructed deathwatched<T> objects.

	* Internal rewrites to reduce compilation times

v3   2015-04-02

	* Fixed compiler dependent reference binding SNAFU

v2   2015-04-02

	* Improved compilation time performance. 20% drop in compilation time
	  has been seen in some test programs.

	* Improved the compiler's chance to provide good warning messages
	  when values in expectations don't quite the types used in the
	  function signature (for example signed/unsigned mismatch.)

	* Added support for tracing matching calls. This is an aid when
	  doing exploratory tests of legacy code. A trace can often
	  drastically reduce the time required to understand how the legacy
	  code works.

	  To use it, create an object of a tracer type, for example:

	    TEST(atest)
	    {
	      trompeloeil::stream_tracer trace(std::cout);

	      // normal test code
	    }

v1   2015-01-10

	First official release.
